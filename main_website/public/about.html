      <h2>The goal:</h2>
      <p>
        Brandon sandersons cytonic universe is awesome and I've always wanted to make a video game. 
        Put the two things together and I've always thought you could get a great combo. I also like the 
        hit indie game FTL, since I had never made a game before I thought FTL's formular could be adapted 
        without too much of a learning curve to the cytonic setting.
      </p>

      <p>
        I should note that I dont own brandon sandersons works, nor have I gotten any kind of permission to make content 
        for him or his company. This is a fan project, and since I wont be amking any money on it I think it will be ok 
        If I am mistaken I will pull the project down.
