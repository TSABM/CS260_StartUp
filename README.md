# CS260_StartUp
## the pitch
The pitch is simple: Imagine playing a game that captures the wonder of Brandon sandersons works. He writes compelling stories and has said that he wants someone to adapt his stories into video games, why not do that here? The hit indie game FTL is a simple top down 2-d game where the player controls crew on a space ship, Brandodn Sanderson has a sci fi series caled the cytoverse that could be used for a FTL like game that you could play in the browser. Plus in case we couldnt pair it with Brandon Sandersons works his cytoverse is strongly inspired by already existing fiction so if the game was built and had to be debranded it would be very easy.

## meeting the requirements
I listed in the photo how I hope to meet the project requirements but to repeat.
  **Authentication** Simply I will have a log in process
  **Database Data** I will record high scores, and possibly data for asyncronous online play
  **Web socket data** Ideally I want syncronous online play, but barring that some kind of chat could work too
