# This is my notes
## setting up github
I learned in this assignment how to set up git with my VS code environement, how to handle SSH keys, and a little about commits and merges.

## html
I reviewed and learned html structure and completed the code pen

## CSS
I have done the requested code pens and deployed the updated simon folder. I am reviewing the simon example as I put CSS on my main page

## CSS cont.
I have reworked styling for the pages, in general they work fine, though the gameplay page needs work... a lot of work. Luckily the layout is easy enough that everything works even when resized. That will change when the game is implimented in javascript.

### Midterm notes:
    In the following code, what does the link element do?
      The <link> tag defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource.
      The <link> tag is most often used to link to external style sheets or to add a favicon to your website.
      The <link> element is an empty element, it contains attributes only.
    
    In the following code,  what does a div tag do?
      defines a division or a section in an HTML document
    In the following code, what is the difference between the #title and .grid selector?  
      Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class) ex: p{}selects all p elements, #para1{}selects only this id,       
        .center selects a class. there are several ways to stack this including <p class "c1, c2"></p>. 
      Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them) ex:
        descendant selector (space)
        child selector (>)
        adjacent sibling selector (+)
        general sibling selector (~)
      Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state) ex: done in the style selector:pseudo-class{} though details change
      Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element) ex: selector::pseudo-element{}
      Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value) ex: a[targetAttribute]{}

    In the following code, what is the difference between padding and margin?
      In CSS, a margin is the space around an element's border, while padding is the space between an element's border and the   
      element's content. Put another way, the margin property controls the space outside an element, and the padding property 
      controls the space inside an element.

    What does the following code using arrow syntax function declaration do?

      } 
      after:
      hello = () => {
        return "Hello World!";
      } 
      when you only have one statement: hello = () => "Hello World!";  works too
      passing in vals: hello = (val) => "Hello " + val; and withotu parens: hello = val => "Hello " + val;
