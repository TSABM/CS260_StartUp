# This is my notes
## setting up github
I learned in this assignment how to set up git with my VS code environement, how to handle SSH keys, and a little about commits and merges.

## html
I reviewed and learned html structure and completed the code pen

## CSS
I have done the requested code pens and deployed the updated simon folder. I am reviewing the simon example as I put CSS on my main page

## CSS cont.
I have reworked styling for the pages, in general they work fine, though the gameplay page needs work... a lot of work. Luckily the layout is easy enough that everything works even when resized. That will change when the game is implimented in javascript.
